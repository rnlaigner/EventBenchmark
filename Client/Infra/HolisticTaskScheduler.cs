     *  Adapts to failures in the target microservice online (during execution)
     *  to avoid overwhelming the target service with too many requests
     *  
     *  The strategy is to start with some requests and slowly increase parallelism
     *  For every failure, concurrency is decreased by half. For every substantial
     *  number of requests accepted (e.g., a magnitude increase compared to start),
     *  the concurrency is increased.
     *  
     *  Based on example found in:
     *  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler?view=net-6.0
     * 
     *  Maybe assigning stateless actors the role of dealing with failures is a best
     *  approach?
